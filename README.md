# Secret Hitler - React App

## Overview

This is a digital implementation of the popular board game **Secret Hitler**, built using **React**. The app allows players to vote digitally instead of using physical game cards, reducing delays and improving game flow. The purpose of the app is NOT to replace the real game but to streamline the voting process.

#### Create a new game at:

[https://secret-h-companion.web.app](https://secret-h-companion.web.app)

- Enter a unique game code to create or join a room.
- At least one device should function as the "host" to display game progress and manage the voting phase. For better visibility, a TV or laptop screen is recommended.
- The voting interface is optimized for mobile devices, while the host display is best viewed on a larger screen.

## Features

- **Multiplayer support**: Play online with friends.
- **Voting system**: Elect governments and pass policies.
- **UI**: follows the design of the real game

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18.3.1 with Vite 5.4.1
- **Backend**: Firebase
